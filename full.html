								<p>Bacharuddin Jusuf Habibie, better known as BJ Habibie, was a scientist, engineer, and the 3rd President of the Republic of Indonesia. He was born on 25 June 1936 in Parepare, South Sulawesi, and died on 11 September 2019 in Jakarta, at the age of 83 years. BJ Habibie is one of Indonesia's great figures who is remembered for his intelligence, tenacity and dedication in the fields of technology, aviation and his contribution to government.</p>
								<p>Education and Early Career
									BJ Habibie studied at the Bandung Institute of Technology (ITB) before continuing his studies in West Germany on a scholarship. There, he studied at the Rhein Westfalen Aachen University of Technology (RWTH Aachen), one of the best engineering universities in the world. In 1960, Habibie successfully earned a diploma in mechanical engineering with cum laude predicate. Five years later, in 1965, he earned a doctorate in aeronautical engineering with summa cum laude predicate.
									BJ Habibie also received the highest award from ITB, namely Ganesha Praja Manggala Bhakti Kencana, in recognition of his extraordinary contribution in the field of science and technology. His brilliant career in the international world has earned him recognition from many parties.
									
									Glory in the Aviation World 
									One of BJ Habibie's most memorable achievements is his success in creating the Crack Theory or Crack Propagation Theory, which is an important basis for calculating aircraft cracks. This theory is used by many airlines in the world to ensure the safety and durability of aircraft. Because of the success of this theory, BJ Habibie was nicknamed "Mr. Crack" by aviation experts.
									His success in the world of aviation did not stop there. In 1995, Habibie succeeded in making the first aircraft made in Indonesia, named the N-250 Gatot Kaca. This aircraft was produced by IPTN (now known as PT Dirgantara Indonesia) and became a national pride. Even more proud, this aircraft made by BJ Habibie was once purchased by the United States Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Habibie was also eyed by MBB, one of the largest aircraft industries in Hamburg, Germany.
									In addition to aircraft, BJ Habibie also designed special trains to transport large quantities of goods, showing his expertise not only in the aviation sector, but also in land transportation.
									
									Career in Government
									BJ Habibie began to be active in government during the era of President Soeharto. He was appointed as Minister of State for Research and Technology in 1978, a position he held for almost 20 years. In addition, Habibie also led various strategic projects in the development of Indonesian technology.
									In 1998, during the economic crisis that hit Indonesia, Habibie was appointed as Vice President by Soeharto. However, only a matter of months later, he was immediately inaugurated as the 3rd President of Indonesia after Soeharto resigned. During his short term as president, BJ Habibie made important contributions, including establishing the National Commission on Violence Against Women (Komnas Perempuan) in 1998, as an effort to encourage the anti-violence movement against women.
									International Achievements and Awards
									BJ Habibie is an internationally recognized figure for his extraordinary contributions in the fields of technology and science. He received many prestigious awards, including the Edward Warner Award and the von Karman Award, both of which are considered equivalent to the Nobel Prize in aerospace. These awards show how great the influence and dedication of BJ Habibie is to the development of technology throughout the world.
									
									Legacy and Influence
									BJ Habibie is not only known as a technocrat, scientist, and government leader, but also as a figure who cares about humanity. His decision to establish the National Commission on Violence Against Women and his support for the anti-violence movement are proof that he is a progressive leader who is oriented towards social justice.
									BJ Habibie's life story is a perfect example of how intelligence, hard work, and determination can bring about major changes, both nationally and internationally. As a scientist, engineer, and leader, he remains one of the leading figures who inspires many people in Indonesia and the world.</p>
